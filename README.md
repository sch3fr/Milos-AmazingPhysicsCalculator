# Milos-AmazingPhysicsCalculator
Milošova kvalitní fyzikální kalkulačka (internationally Milos' Amazing Physics Calculator) is a windows application that helps with solving physics problems taught at the all mighty GYMKC. First version will be a console app. I hope to bring it to WPF later.<br/>
Shout out to Paleček, since he came up with the idea, but said the way he implemented was slow. This might be a cool challenge.<br/>
Made with love for Milos' shiny bald head <3
