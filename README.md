# IMPORTANT
Both versions of this project will be refractored soon™. By that I mean in the following weeks. I thought I was being smart by not using million if-else branches. It took me way too long to realize that million switch cases is not any better.

# Milos-AmazingPhysicsCalculator
Milošova kvalitní fyzikální kalkulačka (internationally known as the Milos' Amazing Physics Calculator) is a windows application that helps with solving physics problems taught at the all mighty GYMKC. First version will be a console app. I hope to bring it to WPF later.<br/>
## Console version
The console version is somewhat compete, I used it as a learning project during the 100DaysOfCode challenge.
### ToDo
Clean up the code, change all Czech text to English.<br/>
Add all missing features to UI version of the application.<br/>
Migrate from WinForms so WPF
## UI version
UI version is live now. It is missing some features compared to the console version, but I was on kinda tight deadline. I want to add all the features later.
## Credits
Shout out to Paleček, since he came up with the idea, but said the way he implemented was slow. This might be a cool challenge.<br/>
Made with love for Milos' shiny bald head <4
